            <p>
              In the age of robotic fabrication, additive manufacturing is often framed as a method for producing identical replicas of digital models, neglecting a potential role in the design process itself. Digital fabrication tools are frequently positioned as file-to-factory systems, limiting opportunities for autonomy and ownership during production. In an effort to connect the accuracy and capacities of computational machines with the creative role of the craftsperson, this project investigates how real-time interaction during fabrication affects perceived agency, satisfaction, and engagement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Using ceramic extrusion as a materially contingent medium, the study examines whether intervening during the printing process alters how designers experience authorship. Participants designed their own digital files and then either observed or interacted with the machine during fabrication through constrained real-time parameter adjustment. Rather than treating deviation as error, this work positions variability as a site of negotiation between human intention and machine execution.

                    Thirteen self-identified designers with no prior experience in ceramic 3D printing participated in the study. Each participant began by designing a print file through a simple interface that allowed them to draw a closed two-dimensional curve, which was then extruded into a three-dimensional form. This approach was selected to ensure that participants retained authorship over the initial geometry without requiring advanced modeling expertise. It was important that users felt a sense of ownership over their file rather than working from a predetermined toolpath.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Participants were divided into four experimental conditions differentiated by degrees of real-time control. The Control group designed their file but had no ability to modify the print once fabrication began. Groups A, B, and C were all given access to a live interface featuring two sliders controlling machine speed and extrusion rate. The interface remained visually identical across groups, and all numerical values and units were obscured to prevent participants from inferring the extent of their control. What differed between these groups was the size of the parameter window available behind each slider.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Group A was given the largest adjustment range, allowing for substantial deviation from ideal printing parameters. Group B was assigned a moderate range. Group C was given the narrowest window, such that even extreme slider movement produced only subtle changes in the print. The Control group printed using fixed parameters that had been previously identified as optimal for print fidelity. This structure allowed the study to examine not only the presence or absence of control, but also how varying degrees of constraint influence perception.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The experiment proceeded in four phases. Participants completed a pre-print survey documenting baseline emotional state, confidence, and prior experience. They then produced a small test print to become familiar with the machine and, where applicable, the causal relationship between slider input and print behavior. This was followed by fabrication of the participant’s designed object, during which interaction groups were free to adjust parameters in real time. Participants were instructed that there was no prescribed goal; they could pursue replication, exploration, or variation according to their own criteria. Finally, participants completed a post-print survey assessing perceived autonomy, satisfaction with process and outcome, confidence, and emotional state.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    All prints were produced on the PotterBot 9 Micro ceramic 3D printer using a white stoneware clay body. Material variables such as air bubbles and minor fluctuations in plasticity were not fully controlled, and these contingencies were treated as part of the fabrication context rather than experimental noise.

                    The resulting objects demonstrated that outcomes in ceramic additive manufacturing are shaped as much by interaction during fabrication as by the initial digital file. Even within the Control group, prints deviated from their digital counterparts due to material behavior. In the interaction groups, real-time adjustment served two primary roles. Some participants used parameter changes to correct issues as they emerged, such as sagging or inconsistent extrusion. Others treated the sliders as a compositional tool, deliberately introducing variation during the print.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Despite working from similarly simple initial geometries, the printed results varied widely across and within groups. These variations reflected differences in participant intent as well as differences in perceived agency. Some participants prioritized maintaining fidelity to the digital model, while others embraced deviation as a productive outcome. Importantly, the same interface supported both approaches, but the extent of available control shaped how participants interpreted what was possible.

                    Perceived autonomy was measured through a post-print survey on a scale from 0 to 100. The Control group reported an average autonomy of 50 percent. Group A reported 77 percent, Group B 76 percent, and Group C 65 percent. While higher degrees of control generally corresponded to higher autonomy ratings, the most notable result was that Group C, despite having the narrowest parameter window, still reported significantly greater autonomy than the Control group.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This finding suggests that awareness of constrained agency is preferable to passive observation. Even limited opportunities for intervention altered participants’ perception of ownership. The similarity between Group A and Group B further indicates a threshold effect, wherein increasing the range of control beyond a certain point no longer produces meaningful changes in perceived autonomy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Confidence and satisfaction followed related but distinct patterns. Groups A and B reported the largest increases in confidence, particularly in their perceived ability to reproduce results. Group C reported lower confidence in replication, reflecting an awareness of constraint, but still expressed greater satisfaction with the process than the Control group. Notably, Group A was the only group to report higher satisfaction with the printed object than with the digital model, suggesting that the value of real-time interaction may outweigh fidelity to the file.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Across groups, participants consistently reported that the ability to interact during fabrication improved their engagement with the process, regardless of whether their goal was replication or exploration. The data indicates that additive manufacturing systems that allow for meaningful intervention during production can shift fabrication from a representational task to an active design process.
