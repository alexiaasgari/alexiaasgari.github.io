            <h2>Fragements Toward Perception</h2>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="text-muted">Spring 2024</span></p>
            <p>Presented at the MIT Museum</p>
            <p>Inspired by nuanced experiences of vision loss and distortion, "Fragments Toward Perception" invites participants to navigate the intricate boundaries between what is captured by the eyes and what is understood by the mind.</p>
            <p>This project unfolds as a journey through a field of chaotically dispersed, emissive white lines that starkly contrast against a dark background. As participants navigate across this plane, they engage with the abstraction from multiple viewpoints, developing a spatial understanding of the line groupings. This process allows viewers to fill gaps in visual perception, piecing together the fragmented contours into a coherent perception of the figure before them. Once the identity of each grouping is realized, even from a static viewpoint, what once appeared nonsensical suddenly gains clarity.</p>
            <p>The scene features obscured human representations, scattered throughout, created through a combination of photogrammetric scanning and digital manipulation. Employing the human form facilitates understanding through its recognizability, while also exploring distortions of the body within its natural limitations. Figures posed in motion obscure overtly recognizable stances, enhancing visual interest and varying the density of lines. This not only challenges traditional iconography of the body but also juxtaposes it against our typical perceptions of bodies in action.</p>
            <p>Engagement in this experience is a deliberate act. Only by choosing to explore can more information be unveiled. The slow and deliberate mode of exploration is designed to delay recognition, heightening the eventual moment of clarity as random strokes coalesce into familiar contours. This revelation is both a visual and cognitive epiphany.</p>
            <p>The project raises probing questions for the participant: Is our spatial understanding challenged by seeing forms in atypical poses? To what extent can our perception adapt to unconventional conditions? How much input is necessary for comprehension, and how much familiarity with form is required for understanding? </p>
            <p>It posits that only through obscuration can we truly realize the intricacy of our perception.</p>

                  <p>Physical Form Obscuration</p>
                  <p>Cognitively, vision and perception are intertwined. We saw a car pass by... or did we? Did we simply see a rush of light on the road, and were able to percieve it as a car due to learned context?</p>
                  <p>The project became a reflection on the realities I encountered through my partial loss of vision at the time. It was slow, progressive, something I hadn't noticed, until it was significant. As a visual artist, how does one not notice their own vision loss? The answer came from the brain's ability to alter vision with perception, creating sense of missing information. I dove into the concept of a percieved material world, inspired by readings such as Concious Revisited:Materialism without Phenomenal Concepts by Michael Tye.</p>
                  <p>I explored how I might <b>detangle vision and perception</b> in order to make space between, before the mind was able to make sense of the scene, more apparent.</p>
                  <p>In early studies I placed simple barriers, the way vision obscuration is typically targetted, but this didn't do much for the scene. When I began exploring obscurations of changing the refernce framing, and diffusing the edges, defocusing and confusing the eyes through lack or abundance of stimuli, I began to find that subtle space.</p>

                <div class="mb-5">
                  <p>My fixation on bodies came from the ingrained reconizability of form. I contorted the body physically, working with dancer/chorographer Carly Lave in the MIT Immersion Lab to collect 3D scans in twisting poses. I created a code workflow to further distort the body: splicing the form into stacked 2D contours, and fracturing the continous outlines. Without the context of depth, or seperation, in 2 dimensions, the forms were unrecognizable, particularly when combined into a larger field.</p>

                <div class="mb-5">
                  <p>The clustering of the field was limited by the accessible rendering engines of the VR headsets, though in concept, I find the interaction critical. Many tested the project as it was presented in the Museum. As established, from a static distance, the forms become meaningless texture, but only when the user takes a step forward, do they progresively unviel the information about depth and hierachy. The process required people to physically move through the space. Stepping back the scene was inextricably linked to meaning. Even when re-presented the static image, users could now disect the forms and construct meaning from the scene.</p>
