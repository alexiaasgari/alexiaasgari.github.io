            <p>Illumination is hardwired. Lighting networks require electrical grids, digital chips, and insulated conduit. Material infrastructure allows for immaterial transition. Illumination blurs a building&#39;s boundaries, creating new thresholds and possible contiguities. OS 1.1 harnesses the built infrastructure to extend our sensory registers. We have collaboratively designed an operating system: a lighting network linked by air. As mechanical wooden inputs are touched and turned, lighting outputs change and fluctuate. Manipulation of the physical apparatus directs sensory phenomena along new pathways.</p>

                <div class="mb-5">
                  <p>The initial conceptualization through literature and spatial investigations was a process I personally emersed myself in, leading early research. The space we were given was complex. A busy egress space littered with building code restrictions I poured over. Still there was a desire to embrace such an unusual space, interogating the elements that composed it. I sat for days, first trying to understand through sketches of movement paths, 3D video, decebel recordings, and lux counters. Beyond the physical there was function to the space. I surveyed interactions both in observation and in polling. Yes, an egress point, but also a social setting and a place of observation. I approached the students asking them to draw cognitive maps from memory, marking primary landmarks, paths, and nodes. After some time simply recording as a silent anthropologist, there was a desire to not only interact within, but interact with the space. With all the sensory controls (lighting, temperature, and audio) locked behind the facility walls, I enacted control over my relationship with the space in the only way I knew how... with body. I extended the planes of the walls. I wrapped myself around the surfaces, I felt the space with my body. This exploration through touch and proprioception narrowed the desire to have active control over the space via physical manipulation. In doing so, the intangible electrical grid and the human plane could be connected and interact. </p>

                  <p>OS1.1 has created many prototypes. Each iteration explores how spatial position, proprioceptive feedback, and temporal modulation shape out sense of personal and collective agency. We were invited to test our interactions with our prototypes in the Yale CCAM Lab Initial prototypes operated with physical hinges, floor mounted, allowing transparency to the direct relationship between the user's input force, and the output movement of the light. These still were a bit disconnected from the existing structure and our desire to merge the two plains, hence the movement towards a Bluetooth connection and seemingly minimalist operating mechanisms that hid color scanning components to determine rotation.</p>

                  <p>The installation in Drunker Gallery was subtle. Interacted with by the few who dared to interact with the newly mounted spacial interventions. Some stood trying to create overlaps with the colors, others cased peers around the room with the light. It was subtle, but it shifted gazes, and gave a way to connect the two planes</p>
